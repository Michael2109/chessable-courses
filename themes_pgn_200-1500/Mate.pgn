{ Theme: Back Rank Mate. Plan: keep the enemy king boxed in by its own pawns, deflect or remove the last defender, and land a rook or queen on the back rank to give mate. Watch how each move opens lines, restricts escape squares, or forces concessions that make the final back-rank mate inevitable. }
29. Rb8+
{ Infiltrates the back rank, tying down the king and threatening mate. Check — the king remains boxed in behind its pawn shield on the back rank. }
29... Rc8 30. Rxc8#
{ Back rank mate! The king is trapped by its own pawns and has no escape squares. }
