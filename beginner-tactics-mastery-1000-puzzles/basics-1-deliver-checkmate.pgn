{ Black's king is trapped on the back rank by its own pawns. The rook on e1 has a clear path to deliver the knockout blow! }
39. Re8# { Checkmate! This is the classic back rank mate pattern. Black's own pawns on f7, g7, and h7 prevent the king from escaping, while the rook controls the entire 8th rank. Remember: an undefended back rank is often a fatal weakness! }
