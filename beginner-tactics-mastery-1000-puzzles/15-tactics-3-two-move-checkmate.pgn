{{The Back Rank Mate - A Essential Chess Pattern

The back rank checkmate is one of chess's most satisfying tactical themes. When a king gets stuck on its back rank, trapped by its own pawns, a well-placed rook or queen can end the game instantly.

You'll see this pattern everywhere - from your local chess club to World Championship games. The great thing about back rank mates is that once you know what to look for, you'll start spotting opportunities you never noticed before.

39. Re8# { The classic back rank mate! Black's king is trapped by its own pawns while your rook controls the entire 8th rank. }
