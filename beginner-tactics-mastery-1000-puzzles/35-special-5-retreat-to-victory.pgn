{{Retreat to Victory - Backward Winning Moves

Sometimes the winning move is a retreat! Moving a piece backward can set up devastating threats, improve its position, or create space for other pieces to shine.

These counter-intuitive moves separate strong players from beginners. Learn to consider retreat moves and you'll find winning ideas that others miss completely.
