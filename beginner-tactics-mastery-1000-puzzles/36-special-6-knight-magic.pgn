{{Knight Magic - Octopus Knights & Outposts

Knights are most powerful when they occupy strong outposts - squares that cannot be attacked by enemy pawns. From these "octopus" positions, knights can control key squares and launch devastating attacks.

Learn to establish and exploit knight outposts, and you'll discover why knights can be even more powerful than bishops in certain positions.
