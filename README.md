## Key Design Principles

- **Difficulty progression:**  
  - *Easy* = direct 1-move win.  
  - *Medium* = 2 moves or clear forcing idea.  
  - *Hard* = 2–3 moves with tactic disguised.  

- **Theme repetition:**  
  Patterns like **back rank mates** appear multiple times — direct, disguised, and defensive.

- **Balanced training:**  
  ~65% attacking, ~25% defensive tactics, ~10% practical/endgame & bonus content.

- **Fun factor:**  
  Includes traps, sacrifices, mating nets, and a final "exam" for extra engagement.

## Suggested Learning Path

1. **Basic Mates** → **Back Rank Mates** → **Named Patterns**.  
2. **Hanging Pieces** → **Forks** → **Pins** → **Skewers & X-rays**.  
3. **Removing Defenders** → **Discovered Attacks** → **Pawn Tactics**.  
4. **Defensive Tactics** → **Find the Draw** → **Zugzwang/Opposition**.  
5. **Traps & Sacrifices** → **Mating Nets** → **Anti-Blunder Mates**.  
6. **Mixed Bag Final Exam**.

This ensures a smooth transition from obvious patterns to realistic in-game scenarios, with plenty of variety to keep learners hooked.

## Using the Streaming Puzzle Processing Features

The project now includes advanced streaming puzzle processing capabilities that can handle large Lichess puzzle datasets efficiently.

### Prerequisites

1. **Download the Lichess Puzzles Database:**
   ```bash
   # Download the compressed version (recommended)
   wget https://database.lichess.org/lichess_db_puzzle.csv.zst
   
   # Or download the uncompressed version
   wget https://database.lichess.org/lichess_db_puzzle.csv
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # For compressed .zst files
   pip install zstandard
   
   # Core dependencies
   pip install chess
   ```

### Basic Usage

#### Process All Puzzles by Theme (Streaming)
```bash
# Process all puzzles with basic filtering
python -m app.main --stream-all --csv-path lichess_db_puzzle.csv --min-rating 800 --max-rating 1200 --out-dir themes_pgn_800-1200
```

#### High-Quality Beginner Puzzles
```bash
# Create beginner puzzles with quality filters
python -m app.main --stream-all --csv-path lichess_db_puzzle.csv --min-rating 200 --max-rating 1200 --min-popularity 85 --min-plays 50 --out-dir beginner_puzzles
```

#### Expert-Level Puzzles
```bash
# Create expert puzzles with strict quality filters
python -m app.main --stream-all --csv-path lichess_db_puzzle.csv --min-rating 1400 --max-rating 2000 --min-popularity 95 --min-plays 200 --out-dir expert_puzzles
```

### Key Features

- **Memory Efficient:** Processes millions of puzzles without loading everything into memory
- **Quality Filtering:** Filter by popularity percentile and minimum plays/reviews
- **Difficulty Sorting:** Puzzles are sorted by rating within each theme
- **Difficulty Labels:** Event names include difficulty information (Easy, Medium, Hard, etc.)
- **Theme Organization:** Creates one PGN file per tactical theme

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--stream-all` | Enable streaming processing | `--stream-all` |
| `--min-rating` | Minimum rating filter | `--min-rating 800` |
| `--max-rating` | Maximum rating filter | `--max-rating 1200` |
| `--min-popularity` | Minimum popularity percentile | `--min-popularity 90` |
| `--min-plays` | Minimum number of plays/reviews | `--min-plays 100` |
| `--out-dir` | Output directory | `--out-dir my_puzzles` |

### Output Structure

The script creates one PGN file per theme:
```
output_directory/
├── Fork.pgn
├── Pin.pgn
├── Mate In 1.pgn
├── Back Rank Mate.pgn
└── ...
```

Each file contains puzzles sorted by difficulty, with event names like:
- `"Fork Attack (Medium)"`
- `"Pin the Pieces (Hard)"`
- `"Mate In 1 (Easy)"`

### Performance Notes

- **Memory Usage:** Constant regardless of CSV size
- **Processing Speed:** Depends on file size and filters
- **Progress Reporting:** Updates every 10,000 puzzles
- **Incremental Output:** Files created as themes are completed
